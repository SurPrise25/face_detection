# face_detection
This is a new repo I built, inspired by the Braincore Company Product Capstone that I wish for myself to get into it further
For now, this code will only ask  you to move your face away to close, hopefully I will uncover more required features in th coming days
After downloading the files, this code needs opencv to run you can do it by typing in the terminal:
```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```
or
```bash
pip install opencv-python
```
After all requirements have been satisfied, you can run the code in your vscode or your terminal with:
```bash
python camera.py
```
