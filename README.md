This is a new repo I built, inspired by the Braincore Company Product Capstone that I wish for myself to get into it further

After downloading the files, this code needs opencv to run you can do it by typing in the terminal:
```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```
or
```bash
pip install opencv-python
```
