# face_detection
This is a new repo I built, inspired by the Braincore Company Product Capstone that I wish for myself to get into it further
For now, this code will only ask  you to move your face away to close, hopefully I will uncover more required features in th coming days
After downloading the files, this code needs opencv to run you can do it by typing in the terminal:
```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```
or
```bash
pip install opencv-python
```
After all requirements have been satisfied, you can run the code in your vscode or your terminal with:
```bash
python camera.py
```
Your camera will open up if nothing goes wrong, you can't press 'x' to exit the camera
To exit it you just need to move your face away from the square and the program will terminate automatically
